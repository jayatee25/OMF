This is a course project for Optimizaition Methods in Finance under Prof. Geetanjali Panda of IIT Kharagpur. This course entailed portfolio diversification through optimization of risk and returns under numerous conditions (such as if the stipulated return is expected to be > 5%, if short-selling is permitted, if the risk needs to have a ceiling limit). Furthermore, the course curriculum also had analysis of various risks such as VAR Risk, MinMax Risk and MAD Risk and their corresponding minimal-risk investment (short selling permitted, short selling not permitted). The data, which is a 2 years day-wise data of various stocks was accumulated from publicly accessible Bombay Stock Exchange website. The coding assignments also include data visualization forbetter understanding. This course has expanded my knowledge in the domain of portfolio diversification to a significant extent.
